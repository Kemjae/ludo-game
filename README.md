 🎲 Ludo Random Number Game

This is a simple Ludo board game simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main focus of this project is practicing *random number generation* to simulate a dice roll.  

I created this project as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. It helped me understand how to work with randomness and update the DOM dynamically.

 🎮 How It Works

- A dice button is displayed on the screen.
- When you click the button, it generates a random number between *1 and 6*.
- The number is shown on the dice to simulate a roll.
- This basic functionality can be extended into a full Ludo game in the future.
